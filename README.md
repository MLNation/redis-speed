# redis-speed

Redis is an open-source in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.
It is often used in distributed software systems, and system design interviews.
It is helpful for engineers to know how well Redis performs.

In this repository, we assess Redis's throughput by sending requests using Python.
